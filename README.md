# Codemore

[Codemore](https://codemore.herokuapp.com/home) allows users to practice coding using a code editor as well as visualize their aggregated data from the most visited developer platforms. Codemore uses a test based approach to improve a user's algorithm skills. In addition to improving their technical skills, the platform promotes active involvement in the developer community by providing a snapshot of their online developer presence on Medium, Codewars, Github, and Stack Overflow. Developed using the NERDS Stack, Codemore utilizes Docker to securely evaluate user submitted code.
